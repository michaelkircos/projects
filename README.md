# This is my **PROJECTS** repo

## Anything personal I'm working on or tinkering with will wind up in here.

### GOALS:

- [ ] Master git
- [ ] Make my own automation tools
- [ ] Document my code
- [ ] Learn and Grow as a developer


I'm getting pretty used to using the following commands in `iTerm`:
```
git clone git@<repo>
git add
git commit -m "Some commit message"
git push
```
